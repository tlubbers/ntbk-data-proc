## Grading Scheme
A = 360‐400 pts, B = 320‐359 pts, C = 280‐319 pts, D = 240‐279 pts, F = less than 240 ptsv

### Exams (240 points)
There are three exams, all closed‐book and noncumulative. Materials for the exams will be taken from
lectures, labs and assignments. No make‐up exams unless the student has a documented illness or
emergency. Punctuality is important; no one will be admitted once the first student turns in the exam.
Note:  One must total at least 168 points (70%) on the exams to earn a course grade of “B” or higher.  
This syllabus is a living document and is subject to change.

### Assignments (70 points)
Effective learning of technical course material requires practice. To receive credit for lab assignments, the
work must be checked *in class* by the instructor. Submission via other means (e.g., email, hardcopy) will
NOT be accepted and thus will not receive credit. NO late work will be accepted unless the student has a
documented illness or emergency.

### Database Project (70 points)
Students will work on a database design and implementation project to integrate and apply what you have
learned in the class.  Project deliverables and respective due dates will be provided in class at a later date.
Submissions that are less than 24 hours late will be accepted with a 20% deduction; those that are more
than 24 hours late will not be accepted unless there is a documented emergency. The instructor reserves
the right to assign different assignment/project grades to different team members based on team
participation and contribution (i.e., no free rides). 

### Attendance (20 points)
Regular attendance is important. Each student starts the semester with a perfect attendance score, and
each subsequent absence leads to a deduction of 4 points unless there is a documented illness or
emergency. Note that those who are not present throughout the *entire* class session (e.g., leaving early,
arriving late for more than 5 min) will be deemed as absent. The absent student will be responsible for the
materials, assignments and/or announcements missed.

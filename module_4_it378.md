# Module 4 - Extended ERD

Extended ERD adds hierachial tools to the standard ERD.

Supertypes are like interfaces, subtypes extend them. A supertype can either require its instances to be one of the subtypes, or not require it be a subtype at all. Also we specify if an instance can be more than one subtype.

Thats about it for mod4. See slides for examples.
